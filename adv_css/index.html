    <p> Giraffes are the tallest living land animals, standing at over 18 ft. tall. They have long necks and legs, which allow them to browse on tall trees and branches for food. Giraffes are a herbivore species. The animal's most common forms of nutrition are leaves, twigs, and berries. Giraffes live on the plains of eastern Africa and have a light brown coat with reddish brown spots. They are known for their keen sense of smell and their ability to keep an eye on predators like lions and hyenas.

         <h2 class=" heading_style">The Evolution of The Giraffe</h2>
    <p>There is solid evidence that leads researchers to believe giraffes are a sister taxon to antelopes. Meaning there is a genetic similarity between the two. Reaserchers estimate the split between the two species to have began over 20 million years ago. One question many have about the evolution of the giraffe is, How did they develop such a long neck?  Researchers concluded from a comparison between the giraffe and its ancient ancestors that the elongation of the neck started early on in the giraffe's lineage. Overtime they have developed into the tall majestic creatures we know today. </p>
