The Giraffe Conservation Organization says the population of giraffes has declined significantly in the past years. It is estimated that there are only around 117,000 individuals that remain.

    <hr>
    <p>There are many ways to help giraffes become less endangered. Donating time or money to a conservation organization is a great way to aide them through the hard times. Another way to help is simply raising awareness of the issue. Many live there day to day lives unaware of the current status of the giraffe population. A third way to help is by supportng the legal protection of giraffes. As a species, they need all the help they can get! So, the amount of individuals supporting their legal protection plays a crucial role in their future.  </p>
