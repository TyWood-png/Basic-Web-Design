         <h3 class=" heading_style">Average Life Expectancy Of A Giraffe</h3>

         <p>Giraffes have a lifespan that typically ranges between 20 to 25 years in the wild, although some individuals can live even longer in captivity, with lifespans extending to about 28 years. This remarkable longevity is largely influenced by environmental factors such as food availability, predation pressures, and disease, as well as the specific habitat in which they reside.</p>

         <h3 class="heading_style">Captivity</h3>
         <p>Giraffes in captivity, particularly those in well-maintained zoos or wildlife reserves, tend to live longer due to a controlled environment. They are less exposed to predators and environmental stresses, and they receive regular veterinary care, a steady supply of food, and protection from extreme weather conditions. This more stable environment often allows them to live beyond their average wild lifespan. </p>

         <h3 class="heading_style">In The Wild</h3>
         <p>In the wild, giraffes face several challenges that can affect their lifespan. Predators like lions, hyenas, and crocodiles are potential threats, particularly to young giraffes. As they grow, giraffes gain the advantage of their height, which allows them to spot danger from a distance. However, even adults are not completely free from danger. In times of drought or food scarcity, their health can deteriorate, reducing their chances of survival. Injuries from fights with other giraffes or accidents can also limit their lifespan in the wild. </p>
